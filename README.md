## About this repository

This respository is used for a practical work from the Software Testing for Embedded Systems course (2023). This course belongs to the Master's Degree in Embedded Systems at the Universidad de Buenos Aires (UBA).

Here Unit Testing is applied to the UAI (User Application Interface) part of a driver for the FS-A8S radio control receiver from FlySky. For more information see [FlySky FS-i6X radio control model](https://www.flysky-cn.com/i6x-gaishu-1).

Note: This driver is dived in to main parts: User Application Interface (UAI) for the high-level abstraction layer part and Hardware Interface (HWI) for the low-level abstraction layer part. The first part is tested here.

Moreover, this driver is part of my Master's Degree thesis "Development of a Quadcopter Flight Controller".
